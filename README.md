# Predicting NPS in Aviation Industry ✈️

This project analyzes customer satisfaction in the **aviation industry** by predicting the **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** using linear regression techniques. The aim is to identify which service factors most strongly influence whether a customer becomes a Promoter, Passive, or Detractor, providing strategic insights for improving airline services.

## 📊 What This Project Does

- Loads and filters an aviation industry survey dataset
- Focuses on numeric experience metrics (e.g., cleanliness, staff efficiency, check-in experience)
- Predicts the **number of Promoters** using **Linear Regression**
- Evaluates the model with **R² Score** and **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**
- Visualizes correlation between service dimensions to guide improvement strategies

## 📁 Dataset Columns (Examples)

- `Toilet_cleanliness__c`
- `Staff_efficiency_at_the_counter__c`
- `On_board_experience__c`
- `Clarity_of_crew_announcements__c`
- `Promotors__c`, `Passive__c`, `Detractors__c`

## 🧠 ML Techniques Used

- **Linear Regression**
- **Train/Test Split**
- **Model Evaluation:** R² Score, RMSE
- **Correlation Heatmap** for feature insights
